        <h2>On Simulacral Economy</h2>
            <p><span class="date">Wednesday, December 3, 2025</span></p>


        <p>I have been fortunate enough to work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~ev2124/">Eric Verhoogen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz">Joe Stiglitz</a> during my first year as a predoc. By the end of 2025, I have worked mostly helping with their new paper, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.bilgeerten.com/">Bilge Erten</a>, which is <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~ev2124/research/BPEA_CHIPS_ESV_20251103.pdf">out now</a> if you are interested. Most of my time is spent working with Eric, who is a great mentor and took a shot with me when no one else would, but I do also get to spend time with Stiglitz. I wanted to share a rephrase of a particular conversation I had with him where I shared some of the unresolved questions at the intersection of philosophy and economics that stimulate my interest. I have taken an interest in the role of the sign-value and semiotics, and how both they and the simulacrum process relate to the capitalist mode of production. I believe it to be true that there is potential here, within both rational choice mainstream economics, and in the ellaboration of many alternative theories and counterargumentations to all sorts of ideologies.  </p>

        <h3>Victor Ortega asks Joe Stiglitz</h3>

        <p>I want to ask three contentious questions that hopefully do not come off as too strange.</p>

        <p>Firstly: in reading the debates between the minimax decision rule of Rawls and Harsanyi's axiomatic postulation of the Bayesian rational and Pareto optimal rule-utilitarian theory of morality, i.e expected-utility maximization, it became increasingly obvious to me that they were running in circles around consequential ontology. I personally believe that moral wrongness occurs when exclusionary relations are built on ontological non-categories built from the exterior. This moral theory is relational conditional on social structure and assumes categories are not symbolic. It ought to be that this is incompatible with morality being defined as rules of individuals aggregating preference orderings over outcomes. And yet I am here ay Columbia working with you and within the mainstream, and that is because I do think that this model of <i>as if</i> maximization is very powerful representation. But I guess this is my fundamental concern: are these artifications not tautological of the current social order and mode of production? Are we not eroding the mountains ourselves by mapping them as such?  Might this be a reason for why many academic economists do not seem to care about inequality and see themselves as neutral in the policy process?   </p>
        <p>Secondly: I wanted to ask about the profit incentive to innovate. The incentive to me is exactly that, to innovate for profit, and thus not always necessarily always in the benefit of society i.e. Palantir, Purdue Pharma. You <a href="https://competitionandappropriation.econ.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/95/2018/06/Stiglitz1993_Market_Socialism_and_Neoclassical_Economics.pdf">(Stiglitz, 1993)</a> described the Lange-Lerner-Taylor characterization of market socialism as <i>simply ignoring the role of innovation in the economy.</i> My question is, in systems that decommodify information, are there institutional substitutes that generate sustained innovation? </p>
        <p>This ties in nicely to my last question which is perhaps my most outrageous. It is not entirely intuitive to me that under asymmetric information allocations under a command economy and monopolistic competion have dissimilar social welfare. What assumptions would a model like this require for the central planner to have at least as good welfare as this distorted market? Are there any? The relevance of posing this question to me is the following. I believe that the function of conspicuous commodities is semiotic: sign-value that signifies social status <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272797000169">(Corneo and Jeanne, 1997)</a>. This notion of higher quality is a big deterrent for people to leave regimes like Venezuela, Cuba, etc: access to higher quality commodities and luxury goods. To me, this is the world of the hyperreal, and in the upcoming developments of the simulacrum it is not too hard to imagine a virtual replication of reality. I know this sounds very very wacky but if this were to pass, what will the mode of production look like? </p>

        <h3>Joe Stiglitz responds to Victor Ortega</h3>

        <p>So I straight up read the first section uninterrupted, which might have not been the most sensible option as it is dense in content. Joe's response is summarized to the best of my ability as follows.</p>

        <p>“Broadly: Equilibrium theories stat. world evolutionary biology. Virology. No eq to virus. We can predict but not the same as physics. One aspect: humans. Preferences. u’s are endogenous. Ppl care. Economic system affects sympathy, empathy, etc. Catastrophic society. Moral POV. rel w.r.t. Smith’s formulation. High level of imprecision. risk avers or not behind veil of ignorance? Harsanyi also has imprecisions ‘Ppl don’t know outcome. Ruling out unethical positions. Unknownness in the foreepistle. Cant know this. Common knowledge. Information hardware is incomplete. We can really deal with infinities. Inference on future will be different. Can’t let ppl starve. Morality is unacceptable. Arrow says no ordering. Decisions get rid of things that are bad. Some randomness in that remains. Capitalism creates individuals that destroy the capts system as they see it. System is internally inconsistent. Allow distrust. Frankenstein breaks all rules and destroys competitive equilibrium. Lack of empathy is immoral.”</p>

        When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
        \[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}. \]
