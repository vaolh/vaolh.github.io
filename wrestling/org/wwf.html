    <h1>World Wrestling Federation</h1> <p>The <b>World Wrestling Federation (WWF)</b> is an international <a href="/wrestling/wiki.html">professional wrestling</a> organization based in the United States. It is one of the three major sanctioning bodies, alongside the <a href="/wrestling/org/wwo.html">World Wrestling Organization (WWO)</a> and the <a href="/wrestling/org/iwb.html">International Wrestling Board (IWB)</a>. The WWF sanctions championships across four men’s divisions—Welterweight, Middleweight, Bridgerweight, and Heavyweight—and two women’s divisions—Lightweight and Featherweight. Its world titles are regarded as the most prestigious in professional wrestling. Governance is conducted by a board of commissioners that coordinates with U.S. state athletic commissions to oversee rules, rankings, mandatory challengers, and championship recognition.</p> <p>The WWF traces its origins to the early 1960s, emerging from the consolidation of NWA territories under the <b>World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF)</b>, promoted by Roderick "Jess" McMahon and Toots Mondt. It expanded nationally under Vince McMahon in the 1980s, developing into a multi-billion-dollar entertainment business with global reach. Its growth drew scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers, with senators questioning the legitimacy and safety of professional wrestling, leading the organization to maintain close compliance with state athletic commissions while continuing to expand commercially. In the 2000s, the WWF rebranded as <b>World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)</b>, becoming a publicly traded corporation with global media rights, merchandising, and live event revenue in the billions. During this period, allegations of match manipulation and scripted outcomes caused disputes over the legitimacy of its championships.</p>

    <p>Following the 2020 unification agreement with the WWO and IWB, the organization reverted to the historic WWF name for its sanctioning authority. The deal created a unified ruleset for matches, officiating, and discipline, while each body created new world championships across four men’s and two women’s divisions, with tag team and trios titles discontinued.  <a href="/wrestling/org/ring.html"><i>The Ring</i></a> magazine was recognized as an independent authority for lineal championships and  <a href="/wrestling/org/ring#p4p">pound-for-pound rankings</a>. The agreement also established a <a href="/wrestling/ppv/list.html">shared calendar of events</a>, including an annual openweight tournament (The Open), a <a href="/wrestling/wiki#trios">trios tournament</a>, and the bimonthly  <a href="/wrestling/wiki#tv">World Title Series</a>, which features mandatory title defenses and contender matches from all three organizations. </p>

    <p>Many historically high-profile bouts have been sanctioned by the WWF, with numerous notable <a href="/wrestling/wrestlers/index.html">wrestlers</a> recognized as world champions under its titles. The WWF remains the most influential sanctioning body under the unified ruleset, with its championships recognized as the most prestigious in professional wrestling. It continues to present <i>WrestleMania</i>, the former company’s first-ever pay-per-view and the most successful annual professional wrestling event in history, attracting top talent and global attention. In addition to <i>WrestleMania</i>, the WWF organizes special World Title Series events named after the other four of the historic “Big Five”: <i>Royal Rumble</i>, <i>SummerSlam</i>, <i>Survivor Series</i>, and <i>Money in the Bank</i>, providing a historical platform for mandatory title defenses and number-one contender matches under the unified ruleset.</p></p>
