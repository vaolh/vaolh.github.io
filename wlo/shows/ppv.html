    <h2>WLO Wrestling – World Championship</h2>

    <p>WLO Wrestling – World Championship is a Mexican sports television series broadcast on the national network Imagen Televisión. The program is the flagship broadcast of World Lucha Organización (WLO) and serves as the main platform for its most prominent title defenses and major storylines. It features numbered pay-per-view (PPV) supercards and the WLO Grand Prix (a series of openweight, single-elimination tournaments for both men's and women's divisions) on Saturdays. On Thursdays, the  branding is also used intermittently on the weekly broadcast Jueves de WLO Lucha Libre on Imagen Televisión, typically for high-stakes matches, title eliminators, or international showcase bouts, as well as for the WLO Contender Series qualifying matches for the numbered PPVs.  </p>
