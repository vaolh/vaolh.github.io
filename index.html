<br>
these are some things you will find here:<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RADIO</b> is for a radio program that i did at KCSB-FM 91.9 in santa barbara from september 2005 through september 2017. there are recordings of most of the shows as well as playlists for many of them. i played diy music and often had bands play live or played live show recordings. i went back to KCSB in 2020 at the start of the pandemic and produced a program remotely along with other alumni programmers. i left kcsb again in october 2022. i hope to continue this at another station someday but for now i am doing it in podcast form from my bedroom.<br>
<br>
<b>SHOWS + BOOTLEGS</b> is a mostly complete list of every show i've ever been to. i recorded audio from many of them and you can listen if you'd like. i like to listen to the show recordings because i can close my eyes and picture it also, because i was there. but i imagine you could enjoy them even if you weren't there. someday i hope to get all the flyers that i can find up as well but it'll take a long butt time, so, someday.<br>
<br>
<b>PHOTOS</b> is a place for photographs that i have taken. i carry around a film camera with me and take photogs and sometimes they turn out nicely. i don't know what i'm doing.<br>
<br>
<b>VIDEOS</b> is videos. mostly videos of <a href="http://www.5432fun.org/videos/bands">bands</a> that i have recorded, but maybe other things as well. some are on vhs and digitized and some are digital. none of it is of particular quality but it's just nice to have the visuals for the archive. i also digitized all the <a href="http://www.5432fun.org/videos/homemovies">home movies</a> my parents took and i'm including some choice ones here. i dumped a bunch of videos in the -assorted projects- folder as well.<br>
<br>
<b>VHS</b> is a mostly up-to-date list of all the vhs tapes i've acquired. however, i drove my car over and set fire to all my woody allen and bill cosby tapes, so those were destroyed. just haven't taken them off the list yet. i have some to add to this list but honestly, having to pack them all up to move and paying to keep them in storage for nine months until i could make room for them in my parents garage sort of turned me off. i still look out at thrift stores for especially weird one, but bleh. it was fun for a while. i still love them though. someday i home to have a living space where i can display them properly.<br>
<br>
<b>TV</b> is an accountability process that i imposed upon myself regarding all the time i've spent watching television. now, this only includes serialized programs that i've watched on the internet. but it's a lot. i've spent about 10% of my time since june 2010 watching. it's wild. but, new year new me, i'm in the midst of a successful break (not including re-watching the office over and over again). pray for me. UPDATE: break is over. i'm back at it. more updates someday.<br>
<br>
<b>CAVE BABIES</b> is the title of my music song band thing. just songs that i write. sometimes i play shows too, so please ask me to play. i love to play. the smaller the space the better. there are four -albums- available. there are also some videos of songs up here. UPDATE: since moving to davis i started playing music with friends and hopefully we can share that too!<br>
<br>
<b>ASSORTED PROJECTS</b> are exactly what they sound like. things i've done or am doing that are sort of separate creatures or just don't quite fit anywhere else. maybe they're not worth sharing but i'm sharing them anyway. they currently include: <a href="http://www.5432fun.org/affectpedals">affect pedals</a> / <a href="http://www.5432fun.org/assproj/howtoplaysolitaire">how to play solitaire</a> / <a href="http://www.5432fun.org/assproj/unicorn">unicorn</a> / <a href="http://www.5432fun.org/assproj/motivationalvideos">motivational videos</a> / <a href="http://www.5432fun.org/assproj/tohaveagoodday">to have a good day</a> / <a href="http://www.5432fun.org/assproj/collect">collect</a> / <a href="http://www.5432fun.org/assproj/flipfoneself">flip fone self</a> / <a href="http://www.5432fun.org/assproj/dogaday">dog a day</a><br>
<br>
<i>projects that need to be added:</i><br>
* self portrait shrinky dink<br>
* stop motion<br>
* keyboard square<br>
* <a href="http://www.goodandweirddavis.org">goodandweirddavis.org</a><br>
<br>
<b>FRIENDS</b> is a list of other friendly websites that i would like to support. and, just, friends that i would like to support. and would like you to support too, as well, if you want to. UPDATE: i haven't made this page yet - sorry.<br>
<br>
<b>ABOUT</b> is just some information about me: life events, professional, musical, medical, fashionable, etc. it's basically the outline to the memoir i'll never write. embarassing.<br>
<br>
