    <h1>World Wrestling Organization</h1>

    <p>The World Wresling Organization (WWO) is an international professional wrestling organization based in Mexico. It is among the three major organizations which sanction professional wrestling bouts, alongside the <a href="/wrestling/org/wwf.html">World Wrestling Federation (WWF)</a> and the <a href="/wrestling/org/iwb.html">International Wrestling Board (IWB).</a>  The WWO awards its world championship titles at the professional level, and is colloqually known by wrestling fans as <i>La Mundial</i>.</p>

    <p>Many historically high-profile bouts have been sanctioned by the WWO, with numerous notable wrestlers recognized as world champions under its titles. All three major organizations acknowledge each other’s legitimacy, and their histories are interwoven through decades of competition, collaboration, and shared rule frameworks.</p>

    <p>The WWO aims to promote and elevate Lucha Libre on a global scale. Rooted in Mexican wrestling traditions, it brings together top wrestlers from around the world to compete in sanctioned matches and championships. The World Title Series, the bimonthly pay-per-view that features title defenses from all three organizations, is regularly held at Arena Coca Cola in Mexico City, which is owned and operated by the WWO. The WWO also created and coordinates <i>LibreMania</i> at Estadio Azteca in partnership with other bodies to celebrate Mexican Independence Day, highlighting the sport’s cultural and international significance.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The World Wrestling Organization traces its origins to the international climate surrounding the 1986 Olympic Games. In the years leading up to the Games, Mexican sporting authorities and several national wrestling commissions pursued an initiative to have lucha libre recognized as a regulated Olympic combat sport. Although the proposal ultimately failed due to opposition from the International Olympic Committee and concerns over professional status, the process generated unprecedented coordination among wrestling commissions across Latin America, Europe, and East Asia. Out of this coordination emerged a permanent international body tasked with standardization and oversight rather than Olympic inclusion. This body would later become the World Wrestling Organization.</p>

    <p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Mexican government attempted to consolidate domestic professional wrestling under a centralized regulatory authority, the Organización Mundial de Lucha Libre. The objective was to bring major private promotions, most notably UWA and CMLL, under a single administrative framework that would govern licensing, matchmaking, and championship recognition. These efforts were met with sustained resistance from promoters, who viewed centralized control as a threat to their economic autonomy and booking power. The conflict escalated as wrestling’s rapid commercial expansion outpaced the capacity of existing commissions to regulate safety, contracts, and international title claims.</p>

    <p>Following prolonged legal disputes and political pressure, the state moved to expropriate the regulatory functions of the major promotions. While the promotions themselves continued to operate as private event organizers, matchmaking authority and championship governance were removed from them and reassigned to the Organización Mundial de Lucha Libre. This marked a structural shift in the industry. The OMLL assumed responsibilities previously held by the Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F., while also acquiring expanded powers over rankings, mandatory contenders, and title sanctioning. As the organization’s authority extended beyond Mexico through reciprocal agreements with foreign commissions, it adopted the English name World Wrestling Organization to reflect its international jurisdiction. It was, however, not the only sanctioning body in professional wrestling. Under this system, promotions were limited to producing and promoting events, while all competitive legitimacy flowed through the WWO. Wrestlers were licensed by the organization, contenders were ranked centrally, and championships were treated as institutional property rather than promotional assets. The initial WWO-recognized titles were the former Mexican National Championships. This framework was designed explicitly to control the expansion of professional wrestling, prevent parallel title lineages, and impose a uniform competitive structure across regions.</p>

    <h2></h2>

    <p>In 2020, the World Wrestling Organization, the World Wrestling Federation, and the International Wrestling Board concluded a multilateral agreement aimed at harmonizing professional wrestling governance while preserving institutional parity among the three bodies. The negotiations were conducted under conditions of clear asymmetry, with the WWF exercising overwhelming commercial, media, and talent leverage. As a result, the final settlement reflected WWF primacy while stopping short of formal absorption of the other sanctioning bodies. The agreement established a WWO-IWB-WWF ruleset as the common regulatory standard for all inter-organizational competition, covering match structure, officiating, and disciplinary enforcement. In exchange, each organization retained its independent championship authority rather than ceding it to a single body.</p>

    <p>Under the terms of the accord, the WWF, IWB, and WWO each instituted their own World Championships across four men’s divisions and two women’s divisions, resulting in four parallel but mutually recognized championship lineages, one per sanctioning authority. Existing titles were vacated and reconstituted under the unified rules framework, while international-level world tag team and trios championships were discontinued as part of a broader effort to streamline title proliferation. As a further concession, the three organizations jointly recognized The Ring magazine as a fourth, independent authority tasked with determining lineal championships within each division and publishing an official pound-for-pound ranking, which would be used for seeding and eligibility across inter-promotional competition.</p>

    <p>The agreement also created a coordinated competitive calendar shared by all three bodies. An annual openweight tournament, known as The Open, was established with participation determined by pound-for-pound rankings rather than weight class or organizational affiliation. A separate annual trios tournament was instituted outside the championship system. In addition, a bimonthly pay-per-view series titled the World Title Series was created as the primary platform for cross-organizational competition. These events mandate the defense of at least one championship from each sanctioning body’s affiliated circuit and include centrally approved number-one contender matches, qualifying gauntlets, and battle royal formats. Through this framework, regulatory authority was unified without dissolving organizational sovereignty, allowing the WWO to function as the coordinating regulator rather than a monopolizing championing body. </p>

    <h2>Rulebook and Championships</h2>

    <p>The WWO codified a standardized ruleset based on traditional lucha libre principles. Matches are generally contested under a one-fall format, with victory achieved by pinfall or submission. A bout may also be won by knocking an opponent out of the ring for a predetermined count, typically twenty, or by disqualification. Disqualifications are enforced for the use of weapons, removal of an opponent’s mask, illegal rope leverage, or other severe infractions. Open-palm strikes are permitted, while closed-fist punches are prohibited. Knee strikes and kicks with the front of the foot are illegal, while kicks delivered with the sole of the foot are allowed. When a wrestler is in contact with the ropes, all holds must be released and no pinfall may be attempted.</p>

    <p>Singles matches are typically scheduled for ten minutes, while championship matches are extended to twenty minutes. Tag team competition follows a distinctive lucha libre rule whereby a team’s legal wrestler may be replaced when he touches the floor outside the ring, allowing a teammate to enter without a formal tag. This rule significantly alters match dynamics and is a defining feature of WWO-sanctioned competition.</p>

    <p>The WWO's prestigious blue championship belt proudly displays the flags of member countries of the organization. All WWO world title belts share the same distinguished design, regardless of weight class. The organization recognizes four primary men's divisions: Welterweight, Middleweight, Brudgerweight, and Heavyweight along with Lightweight and Featherweight for women’s wrestling. You can see the championship reigns in the following section.</a></p>
