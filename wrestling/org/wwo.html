    <h1>World Wrestling Organization</h1>

    <p>The <b>World Wresling Organization (WWO)</b> is an international <a href="/wrestling/wiki.html">professional wrestling</a> organization based in Mexico. It is among the three major organizations which sanction professional wrestling bouts, alongside the <a href="/wrestling/org/wwf.html">World Wrestling Federation (WWF)</a> and the <a href="/wrestling/org/iwb.html">International Wrestling Board (IWB).</a>  The WWO awards its prestigious blue championship belt -- that proudly displays the flags of some member countries of the organization -- at the professional level, and is colloqually known by wrestling fans as <i>La Mundial</i>.  The organization recognizes four primary men's divisions: Welterweight, Middleweight, Bridgerweight, and Heavyweight along with Lightweight and Featherweight for women’s wrestling.  The WWO is governed by a General Assembly where members (officials, promoters, trainers, wrestlers) meet to discuss rules, safety, financial education for fighters, and future goals.</p>

    <p>The World Wrestling Organization traces its origins to the international climate surrounding the 1986 Olympic Games. In the years preceding the Games, Mexican sporting authorities and national wrestling commissions sought to have lucha libre recognized as a regulated Olympic combat sport. Although the effort failed due to International Olympic Committee opposition and concerns over professionalism, it led to the expropriation of sanctioning powers from major promotions, most notably <b>Universal Wrestling Association (UWA)</b> and <b>Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL)</b>. The WWO assumed functions previously held by the Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F., including licensing, rankings, mandatory challengers, and championship recognition. By the late 2020s, the organization had expanded into an internationally recognized governing body, and as of May 2023 it comprised 213 member nations. Espanto VI has served as president since 1999, succeeding the inaugural president, Blue Demon.</p>

    <p>In 2020, the IWB, WWF, and IWB reached an agreement to standardize professional wrestling rules. The deal created a unified ruleset for matches, officiating, and discipline, while each body created new world championships across four men’s and two women’s divisions, with tag team and trios titles discontinued. <a href="/wrestling/org/ring.html"><i>The Ring</i></a> magazine was recognized as an independent authority for lineal championships and  <a href="/wrestling/org/ring#p4p">pound-for-pound rankings</a>. The agreement also established a <a href="/wrestling/ppv/list.html">shared calendar of events</a>, including an annual openweight tournament (The Open), a <a href="/wrestling/wiki#trios">trios tournament</a>, and the bimonthly  <a href="/wrestling/wiki#tv">World Title Series</a>, which features mandatory title defenses and contender matches from all three organizations. </p>

    <p>Many historically high-profile bouts have been sanctioned by the WWO, with numerous notable <a href="/wrestling/wrestlers/index.html">wrestlers</a> recognized as world champions under its titles. The organization also sanctions important  <a href="/wrestling/wiki#apuestas"><i>Lucha de Apuestas</i></a> matches, in which wrestlers wager their mask, hair, or other valuable stakes, with the most common forms being mask-against-mask, hair-against-hair, or mask-against-hair. Putting one's mask on the line against a hated opponent is a tradition in lucha libre as a means to settle a heated feud between two or more wrestlers. These matches are generally contested under a two-out-of-three-falls format with a one-hour time limit. The World Title Series is regularly held at Arena Coca Cola in Mexico City, which is owned and operated by the WWO. The WWO also created and coordinates <i>LibreMania</i> at Estadio Azteca in partnership with other bodies to celebrate Mexican Independence Day, highlighting the sport’s cultural and international significance.</p>
