    <p>The <b>World Title Series (WTS)</b> is a professional wrestling event series jointly owned and sanctioned by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), the World Wrestling Organization (WWO), and the International Wrestling Board (IWB). The series consists of consecutively numbered events and, unlike boxing or mixed martial arts cards, does not feature preliminary bouts, with all matches presented as part of the main broadcast. The WTS debuted in its original form in 2000, when early editions were produced as pay-per-view events and broadcast internationally through ESPN and NHK. Following the interpromotional unification agreement, the series was relaunched in its current unified format in 2020 to standardize championship recognition and competitive rules across the three governing bodies. Most editions of the World Title Series have been held as pay-per-view events, although several exceptions have occurred due to tape-delay and regional broadcast arrangements. Events are jointly produced by ESPN for domestic pay-per-view distribution in the United States and made available via Netflix to subscribers outside the United States. In Japan, the series is broadcast through J Sports, while in Mexico it airs on Imagen Televisión on free-to-air television. The World Title Series serves as the primary platform for interpromotional championship defenses and contender determination outside of annual flagship events.

            <div style="text-align:left; font-size:0.9em; margin:4px 0 0 0;">WrestleMania is known as the SuperBowl of wrestling.</div>
    </div>
    </div>

    <p><b>WrestleMania</b> is a professional wrestling event held annually between mid-March and mid-April by WWF, the world's most powerful professional wrestling sanctioning body. Since premiering in 1985, 41 events have been held, with the first held in Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. WrestleMania was also WWF's first pay-per-view (PPV) produced and is the most successful annual professional wrestling event in history. The event has been broadcast through traditional PPV since 1985 and has been available via livestreaming since WrestleMania XXX in 2014, which was WWE's first major event available through this medium. WrestleMania was named by former WWF ring announcer Howard Finkel. All editions of the event thus far have been hosted in North American cities, with 39 in the United States and two in Canada. WrestleMania 43 in 2027 will be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which will be the first WrestleMania to emanate from outside of North America. Most WrestleMania events have taken place in large stadiums in large cities, with some in sports arenas. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host the year's edition of WrestleMania. WrestleMania centers on the main event matches across two night. Since 1993, the winner of the annual Royal Rumble match receives a guaranteed world championship match at the same year's WrestleMania. Since 2020, the Royal Rumble is held in a special edition of the World Title Series. Forbes named WrestleMania one of the world's most valuable sports event brands from 2014 to 2019, ranking it sixth with a brand value of US$245 million in 2019 behind the Super Bowl, Summer Olympics, NCAA Final Four, the FIFA World Cup, and the College Football Playoffs. A world indoor attendance-record of 93,173 fans was set at WrestleMania III, which was the largest paying attendance in the history of wrestling at the time. The event featured Hulk Hogan defending the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against André the Giant. </p>

    <h3>LibreMania</h3>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p><b>LibreMania</b> is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced and owned by the World Wrestling Organization (WWO). It functions as the WWO’s counterpart to WrestleMania and is one of the two major annual pay-per-view events recognized within the unified professional wrestling system, with the International Wrestling Board (IWB) not owning or promoting any pay-per-view events. LibreMania is traditionally held during the second weekend of September, spanning Saturday and Sunday in conjunction with Mexico’s Independence Day celebrations. Although owned by the WWO, the event is jointly sanctioned by the WWO, WWF, and IWB, and regularly features championship matches and title defenses from all three governing bodies. Across its two nights, LibreMania presents defenses of most active world championships, making it comparable in scale and significance to WrestleMania within the interpromotional calendar. LibreMania is the only event at which <a href="/wrestling/wiki#apuestas"><i>lucha de apuestas</i></a>  matches are permitted, as such stipulations are sanctioned exclusively by the WWO. These matches are sometimes mandated by the organization and may be preceded by qualifying contests, including battle royales, gauntlet matches, or tag team matches, with outcomes influencing participation and protections in subsequent World Title Series events throughout the year, though this structure is not applied uniformly. The event also customarily includes a Memorial Battle Royale honoring wrestlers who died during the preceding year, as well as a ladder match granting a guaranteed WWO championship opportunity. While lucha heritage trios matches have occasionally appeared at LibreMania, they are typically reserved for the annual <a href="/wrestling/wiki#trios">trios tournament</a> rather than the pay-per-view itself. All LibreMania events are held in Mexico City's Estadio Azteca.
