    <h2>WLO Wrestling – World Championship</h2>

    <p>WLO Wrestling – World Championship is a Mexican sports television series broadcast on the national network Imagen Televisión. The program is the flagship broadcast of World Lucha Organización (WLO) and serves as the main platform for its most prominent title defenses and major storylines. It features numbered pay-per-view (PPV) supercards and the WLO Grand Prix (a series of openweight, single-elimination tournaments for both men's and women's divisions) on Saturdays. On Thursdays, the  branding is also used intermittently on the weekly broadcast Jueves de WLO Lucha Libre on Imagen Televisión, typically for high-stakes matches, title eliminators, or international showcase bouts, as well as for the WLO Contender Series qualifying matches for the numbered PPVs.  </p>

    <p style="font-size: small;">Muñoz hit Sikoa with a sledgehammer and was disqualified. After that, he attacked the referee and Sikoa with the weapon and injuring them both heavily. He was suspended for six months. However, this was very unpopular with the fans, who demanded he be reinstated. Santo and Muñoz reached a deal with WLO to fight an unsanctioned <i>Super Libre</i> match. If Muñoz won, he would be reinstated and get a shot at the title at WLO 33. </p>
