        <h2>The Mask Refuses</h2>
            <p><span class="date">Friday, December 12, 2025</span></p>
        <p>Outline: wrestling is hyperreal and the perfect example of a sequence of simulacra. Wrestling as the archaic fight. Mongolia, Senegal, Japan, etc. Try to be extensive, include mexican tradition, the wrestler statues. Speak of ancient boxing a little bit. Then, wrestling and boxing and other sports are circus like. Here there is the first copy, it copies the real fight and the real catch. Speak of Thesz, Gagne, etc. Then prize fighting evolves in paralell, the simulacrum then simulates prize fighting itself. Austin fight vs Juan Manuel Marquez, Floyd rings vs EMLL rings etc. Then the McMahon style becomes self referential, and current wrestling is dogshit bc of this. Mention, for example, McMahonisms in AEW: nonsensical US and Inetrcontinental, copy of NFL draft, etc. Brief mention on how to fight against the hyperreal and symbolic exchange in commodities. Then, what would I do? I will give example only for wrestling. My lucha company goes back to imitating boxing. There is a desire for this in the consumption of the contemporary commodity. Semiotician analysis of the ring, for example. RAW looks nice but PPV looks like ass. So does Arena Mexico Berel. Look at the boxing ones. Ringside, too empty nowadays and so much space, should have like more cameramen interview etc. Reintroduce weight categories, but not so much fluff as in CMLL. And CMLL underprioritizes them since there is no system for it (images of sellout and child) there is clearly demand for this, obv mask vs mask is pinnacle, but you cant have pinnacle every day. Mention Grand Prix and rotation of the show, how many divisions. For example bron breakker looks ridicuolous cause he is simply not big enough, but he could be supermid star. Ref looks ridiculosu with stripes go back to shirt. Tag champs should be the only midcard trio and tag. Should have rounds and judges, perfect opportunity to keep legends on screen without wrestling. Need deal with cultural like television, etc. Rounds allow for draws instead of same old interventions, etc. Authority figure should not be cringe, etc, rogue thing should feel special, no brands, etc. Bring back kayfabe. Promos are ridiculous nowadays, gimmicks, factions, are important but you have the sporting motivation for that. Keep stars chill, why was roman reigns so over? why was cody able to go over? it was entirely sport. atlantis entra aura bc it wasnt full of empty space, you need audience close. you need more people. that way high flighing to outside and ringside fighting can look better, and this was a problem even back in the day, rock austin, etc, but it wa sstill more ppl. </p>
