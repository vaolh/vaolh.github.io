        <h2>Conversations With Stiglitz</h2>
        <div class="post-date">December 3, 2025</div>

        <p>I want to ask three contentious questions that hopefully do not come off as too strange.</p>

        <p>Firstly: in reading the debates between the minimax decision rule of Rawls and Harsanyi's axiomatic postulation of the Bayesian rational and Pareto optimal rule-utilitarian theory of morality, i.e expected-utility maximization, it became increasingly obvious that they were running in circles around consequential ontology. My moral theory is relational conditional on social structure. I personally believe that moral wrongwness occurs when relations are built on false ontological categories. It ought to be that this is incompatible with morality being rules of individuals aggregating preference orderings over outcomes. And yet I am here ay Columbia working with you and within the mainstream, and that is because I do think that this model of <i>as if</i> maximization is a very powerful model of the world. But I guess this is my fundamental concern: are these artifications not tautological in that they are reproductions of the current social order and the capitalist mode of production? Might this be a reason for why many academic economists do not seem to care about inequality and seem to see themselves as policy neutral?   </p>
        <p>Secondly: profit incentive of innovation and Lange market socialism, Arrow as sad.</p>
        <p>Thirdly and perhaps most outrageous: central planning and welfare under asymemtric info? Calculation debtae. </p>
