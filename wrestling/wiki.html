<p> <b>Professional wrestling</b> is regulated, sanctioned wrestling. Professional wrestling bouts are fought for a purse that is divided between the wrestlers as determined by contract. Most professional fights are supervised by a regulatory authority to guarantee the fighters' safety. All high-profile bouts obtain the endorsement of the three major sanctioning bodies, which award championship belts, establish rules, and assign their own referees. These organizations are the <a href="/wrestling/org/wwf.html">World Wrestling Federation (WWF)</a>, the <a href="/wrestling/org/wwo.html">World Wrestling Organization (WWO)</a>, and the <a href="/wrestling/org/iwb.html">International Wrestling Board (IWB). </a> In contrast to amateur wrestling matches, the professional match normally takes place inside a boxing ring.</p>

<p>Professional wrestling gradually developed from competitive catch wrestling in the late 19th century. The three territories where professional wrestling has traditionally best thrived are the United States, Mexico, and Japan.  <a href="/wrestling/wrestlers/index.html">Professional wrestlers</a> in the U.S., which overlaps into Canada, tend to rely on power moves (slams, bombs, drops) and strikes to subdue their opponents. In Mexico, professional wrestling (Lucha Libre) holds are known as <i>llaves</i>, and technicians are known for engaging in <i>llaveo y contrallaveo</i>, or hold and counterholding, where wrestlers flow from hold to hold, and can only be separated by rope breaks. This style is also known as wrestling <i>a ras de lona</i>. Mexican wrestlers are also known for their athletic prowess, their impressive aerial attacks, and for wearings masks. Any wrestler who wishes to wear a mask in the ring must be so licensed by the WWO. It is possible for a wrestler, in a <i>lucha de apuestas</i>, to bet their mask or hair on the outcome of the match, against the opponent’s mask or hair. Japanese professional wrestling (puroresu) incorporates kicks and strikes from martial arts disciplines, and a strong emphasis is placed on submission wrestling. This is also known as Strong Style. </p>

<p>Early professional wrestlers profoundly influenced popular culture. Mexican icons like El Santo and Blue Demon became film stars, appearing in movies that cemented Lucha Libre in national consciousness. Mil Máscaras and El Solitario inspired comic books, merchandise, and public fascination with masked heroes. In Japan, Rikidōzan helped wrestling gain mainstream media attention, appearing on television and shaping national perceptions of the sport. Figures such as Lou Thesz and Bruno Sammartino became household names in North America, drawing large crowds and elevating professional wrestling into a form of mass entertainment. These <a href="/wrestling/org/pwhof.html">Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame (PWHOF)</a> inductees demonstrated that wrestling’s significance extended far beyond competition, shaping identity, storytelling, and popular culture in multiple countries.
</p>

<p>Over the course of the 20th century, wrestling promotions became increasingly accused of scripting or fixing matches. Following intense media scrutiny over the upcoming decades, in 2020, the WWO, WWF, and IWB reached an agreement to standardize professional wrestling rules. The deal created a unified ruleset for matches, officiating, and discipline, while each body created new world championships across four men’s and two women’s divisions, with previous individual, tag team and trios titles discontinued. <a href="/wrestling/org/ring.html"><i>The Ring</i></a> magazine was recognized as an independent authority for lineal championships and  <a href="/wrestling/org/ring#p4p">pound-for-pound rankings</a>. The agreement also established a <a href="/wrestling/ppv/list.html">shared calendar of events</a>, including an annual openweight tournament (The Open), a <a href="/wrestling/wiki#trios">trios tournament</a>, and the bimonthly  <a href="/wrestling/wiki#tv">World Title Series</a>, which features mandatory title defenses and contender matches from all three organizations. The agreement originates from the first incarnation of the World Title Series from the early 2000s, which intended to bring the three styles of wrestling together, and had X shows under a unified ruleset. </p>

<p>The <i>WWF-IWB-WWO Unified Ruleset</i> defines matches as generally contested under a one-fall format, with victory achieved by pinfall or submission. A bout may also be won by knocking an opponent out of the ring for a predetermined count, typically twenty, or by disqualification. Disqualifications are enforced for the use of weapons, removal of an opponent’s mask, illegal rope leverage, eye gouges, blows to the groin, or other severe infractions. Open-palm strikes are permitted, while closed-fist punches are prohibited. Knee strikes and kicks with the front of the foot are illegal, while kicks delivered with the sole of the foot are allowed. When a wrestler is in contact with the ropes, all holds must be released and no pinfall may be attempted. Singles matches are typically scheduled for ten minutes, while championship matches are extended to twenty minutes.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The <b>World Title Series (WTS)</b> is a professional wrestling event series jointly owned and sanctioned by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), the World Wrestling Organization (WWO), and the International Wrestling Board (IWB). The series consists of consecutively numbered events and, unlike boxing or mixed martial arts cards, does not feature preliminary bouts, with all matches presented as part of the main broadcast. The WTS debuted in its original form in 2000, when early editions were produced as pay-per-view events and broadcast internationally through ESPN and NHK. Following the interpromotional unification agreement, the series was relaunched in its current unified format in 2020 to standardize championship recognition and competitive rules across the three governing bodies. Most editions of the World Title Series have been held as pay-per-view events, although several exceptions have occurred due to tape-delay and regional broadcast arrangements. Events are jointly produced by ESPN for domestic pay-per-view distribution in the United States and made available via Netflix to subscribers outside the United States. In Japan, the series is broadcast through J Sports, while in Mexico it airs on Imagen Televisión on free-to-air television. The World Title Series serves as the primary platform for interpromotional championship defenses and contender determination outside of annual flagship events.

    </div>
    </div>

    <p><b>WrestleMania</b> is a professional wrestling event held annually between mid-March and mid-April by WWF, the world's most powerful professional wrestling sanctioning body. Since premiering in 1985, 41 events have been held, with the first held in Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. WrestleMania was also WWF's first pay-per-view (PPV) produced and is the most successful annual professional wrestling event in history. The event has been broadcast through traditional PPV since 1985 and has been available via livestreaming since WrestleMania XXX in 2014, which was WWE's first major event available through this medium. WrestleMania was named by former WWF ring announcer Howard Finkel. All editions of the event thus far have been hosted in North American cities, with 39 in the United States and two in Canada. WrestleMania 43 in 2027 will be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which will be the first WrestleMania to emanate from outside of North America. Most WrestleMania events have taken place in large stadiums in large cities, with some in sports arenas. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host the year's edition of WrestleMania. WrestleMania centers on the main event matches across two night. Since 1993, the winner of the annual Royal Rumble match receives a guaranteed world championship match at the same year's WrestleMania. Since 2020, the Royal Rumble is held in a special edition of the World Title Series. Forbes named WrestleMania one of the world's most valuable sports event brands from 2014 to 2019, ranking it sixth with a brand value of US$245 million in 2019 behind the Super Bowl, Summer Olympics, NCAA Final Four, the FIFA World Cup, and the College Football Playoffs. A world indoor attendance-record of 93,173 fans was set at WrestleMania III, which was the largest paying attendance in the history of wrestling at the time. The event featured Hulk Hogan defending the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against André the Giant. </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p><b>LibreMania</b> is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced and owned by the World Wrestling Organization (WWO). It functions as the WWO’s counterpart to WrestleMania and is one of the two major annual pay-per-view events recognized within the unified professional wrestling system, with the International Wrestling Board (IWB) not owning or promoting any pay-per-view events. LibreMania is traditionally held during the second weekend of September, spanning Saturday and Sunday in conjunction with Mexico’s Independence Day celebrations. Although owned by the WWO, the event is jointly sanctioned by the WWO, WWF, and IWB, and regularly features championship matches and title defenses from all three governing bodies. Across its two nights, LibreMania presents defenses of most active world championships, making it comparable in scale and significance to WrestleMania within the interpromotional calendar. LibreMania is the only event at which <a href="/wrestling/wiki#apuestas"><i>lucha de apuestas</i></a>  matches are permitted, as such stipulations are sanctioned exclusively by the WWO. These matches are sometimes mandated by the organization and may be preceded by qualifying contests, including battle royales, gauntlet matches, or tag team matches, with outcomes influencing participation and protections in subsequent World Title Series events throughout the year, though this structure is not applied uniformly. The event also customarily includes a Memorial Battle Royale honoring wrestlers who died during the preceding year, as well as a ladder match granting a guaranteed WWO championship opportunity. While lucha heritage trios matches have occasionally appeared at LibreMania, they are typically reserved for the annual <a href="/wrestling/wiki#trios">trios tournament</a> rather than the pay-per-view itself. All LibreMania events are held in Mexico City's Estadio Azteca.
