    <p>The World Lucha Organization (WLO) is an international professional wrestling organization based in Mexico. Founded in 2025, the WLO aims to promote and elevate the sport of Lucha Libre on a global scale. With a rich heritage rooted in Mexican wrestling traditions, the WLO brings together the world's top wrestlers to compete in thrilling matches and championships. The organization is committed to preserving the unique style and culture of Lucha Libre while fostering a competitive and entertaining environment for fans worldwide.</p>

    <p>The WLO hosts a weekly show on fridays, as well as several Pay-Per-View events, including their flagship show Libremania that is held every second saturday of September to conmemorate the independence of Mexico. WLO stream their matches on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@worldluchaorganization">Youtube</a> channel. </p>

    <h2>Championships</h2>

    <p>The WLO's prestigious blue championship belt proudly displays the flags of member countries of the organization. All WLO world title belts share the same distinguished design, regardless of weight class. The organization recognizes three primary divisions—Welterweight, Middleweight, and Heavyweight—along with dedicated championships for women’s boxing. </p>

    <p>Between its bi-monthly pay-per-view events in January, March, May, July, September, and November—where all divisions defend their championships—the WLO hosts four prestigious Grand Prix tournaments in February, April, October, and December. These openweight competitions bring together both male and female fighters in a high-stakes knockout format, where the ultimate victor is also awarded a grand prize of 10 million pesos and a beautifully crafted championship belt inspired by indigenous history. Beyond the Grand Prix, August features a chaotic Battle Royale, where numerous competitors clash for supremacy, while June marks the grueling Guerra Sucia matches, where the reigning world champions from the Welterweight, Middleweight, and Heavyweight divisions, as well as the women’s division, must defend their title against four other challengers. Formats include Chamber and Gauntlet matches. </p>

    <h2>Rankings</h2>

    <p>WLO has an official ranking for each weight class, which determines a competitor's ability to challenge for a title. These can be overhauled with tournaments, events, and/or at the promoter's discretion. WLO also recognizes a pound-for-pound ranking by the Box y Lucha </p>
